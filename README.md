# Timesheet

Taking Shoesrb for a ride.

Timesheet is (supposed) to be a small GUI app to track the time that some people have spent doing *something*. You *should* be able to have users, register new ones, open a _shift_ as one of them, and finally close it in another time.

As an _admin_ user, you *should* be able to export the data in some tabular format.
